Senate impeachment trial casts cloud over State of the Union.
President Trump could be defending himself against House Democrats' impeachment charges at the same time he is touting his accomplishments during the State of the Union address, now that the House has sent over articles of impeachment to start a Senate trial.
A similar dichotomy was on display Wednesday. As House Democrats paraded the impeachment articles across the Capitol, Mr. Trump celebrated the signing of the first phase of a historic trade agreement with China.
The impeachment trial loomed for about a month. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, held on to the two articles of impeachment while demanding that the Republican-controlled Senate conduct what she described as a fair trial that would include new witness testimony.
Mr. Trump is all but guaranteed acquittal in the Senate, where it would take a supermajority vote of 67 senators in the 100-member chamber to convict and remove him from office.
"He's been impeached forever. They can never erase that," Mrs. Pelosi aid.
She finally gave up on her attempts to dictate the Senate proceedings, and her chamber voted Wednesday to officially send the articles to the upper chamber.
The four-week impasse ended after a quick march of roughly 750 feet from one side of the Capitol to the other.
Mr. Trump slammed the impeachment saga on Twitter, calling it "another Con Job by the Do Nothing Democrats."
The House's 228-193 vote to transmit the articles of impeachment also deputized seven Democrats to prosecute the case and allocated the use of funds for the trial, which is scheduled to begin Tuesday.
That is just two weeks before the president is set to address the nation in front of Mrs. Pelosi's chamber.
